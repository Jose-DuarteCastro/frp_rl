## üìù Introduction

The **frp_rl** repository aims to bridge the gap between free probability and reinforcement learning. By utilizing free random projections, we can enhance the efficiency of learning algorithms in complex environments. This repository serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring this intersection.

## üîë Key Concepts

### Free Probability

Free probability is a non-commutative probability theory that has applications in various fields, including quantum physics and operator algebras. It allows for the analysis of random matrices and their spectral properties.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, guiding its learning process.

### In-Context Reinforcement Learning

In-context reinforcement learning focuses on adapting the learning process based on the context provided by previous experiences. This approach can improve the agent's ability to make informed decisions.

### JAX

JAX is a numerical computing library that enables high-performance machine learning research. It provides automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU support, making it an ideal choice for implementing complex algorithms.

### Meta-Reinforcement Learning

Meta-reinforcement learning involves training agents to learn how to learn. This approach aims to create agents that can adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal data.

### PopGym

PopGym is a library that provides a collection of environments for reinforcement learning research. It includes various tasks that challenge the learning capabilities of agents.

### Random Matrices

Random matrices are matrices whose entries are random variables. They play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of large systems and have applications in statistics, physics, and machine learning.

### Spectral Analysis

Spectral analysis involves studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. This analysis can reveal important properties of the system being studied.

### State-Space Model

A state-space model is a mathematical representation of a physical system. It describes the system's state at any given time and how it evolves over time.

## üíª Installation

To get started with **frp_rl**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jose-DuarteCastro/frp_rl.git
   cd frp_rl
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have JAX installed. You can find installation instructions on the [JAX GitHub page](https://github.com/google/jax).

4. For additional resources and pre-built binaries, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/Jose-DuarteCastro/frp_rl/releases).

## üöÄ Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using it for your experiments. The main functionalities are encapsulated in the `frp_rl` module.

### Basic Example

Here is a simple example to get you started:

```python
import frp_rl

# Initialize your environment
env = frp_rl.create_environment()

# Create an agent
agent = frp_rl.Agent()

# Train the agent
agent.train(env)

# Evaluate the agent's performance
performance = agent.evaluate(env)
print(f"Agent performance: {performance}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize various parameters when initializing your environment and agent. For example:

```python
env = frp_rl.create_environment(config={
    'max_steps': 1000,
    'reward_threshold': 200,
})

agent = frp_rl.Agent(config={
    'learning_rate': 0.01,
    'discount_factor': 0.99,
})
```

## üìä Examples

We provide several examples in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates a different aspect of using free random projection in reinforcement learning.

1. **Basic RL Task**: A simple task where the agent learns to navigate a grid.
2. **Complex Environment**: An example of a more complex environment that requires advanced strategies.
3. **Meta-Learning**: An example that showcases meta-reinforcement learning techniques.

You can run any example using the following command:

```bash
python examples/example_name.py
```
